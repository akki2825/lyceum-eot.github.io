"Film is one of the three universal languages. Other two being music and mathematics"  said Frank Capra, a celebrated American Film maker.

We are a group of film enthusiasts from diverse professions in science, engineering and arts. As a part of our knowledge sharing initiatives, we've started a Movie Club at BV Jagadeesh Science Centre in Jayanagar, Bangalore.

BV Jagadeesh Science Centre in The National College Jayanagar premises has been venturing into such initiatives to encourage scientific attitude in public.

Screening movies and documentaries of scientific and social concern, discussing everything about the movie and possibly inviting subject experts or film makers themselves are our objectives.

Mark your calendars for every SATURDAY at 4 PM if you wish to join us.

This Whatsapp group is ONLY for updates on upcoming shows and to seek movie suggestions. Clicking on the below link will keep you connected with us.
